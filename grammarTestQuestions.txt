#5 Sarah is going to travel to Japan _______.
A) two months ago 
B) in two months ago 
C) in two months 
D) after two months 
E) None of the above. 

C.  Use "is going to" for the future.  "ago" is for the past, so A and B don't make sense.  D *could* be used,.. if there was more context.  


#6 I _________ sick, so I left work early.
A) feels 
B) felt 
C) feeled 
D) feeling 
E) None of the above. 

B.  "felt" is special (we don't say "feeled", we say "felt", so C is always wrong).   In the sentence " 1 so 2 " 1 must come before 2.  So, if 2 is past tense, then 1 must also be past tense.

A) on 
B) in 
C) within 
D) during 
E) None of the above. 

None.  8:00 is a single point in time, so C and D are wrong.  We don't use
"on" or "in" with time, so those are wrong.

#17 I _________ her somewhere before, but I really don’t remember. She looks familiar.
A) might have meet 
B) might have been meet 
C) might meet 
D) might have met 
E) None of the above. 

The past-participle form of "meet" is "met".  So A and B are wrong.
In the sentence, we have "before" which is the past.  "might meet" is
the future, so it wrong.  "might have met" is correct.  

#18 Severe weather affected _________ people across Japan yesterday.
A) thousands of 
B) thousands 
C) a thousand of 
D) thousand 
E) None of the above. 



#19 I suggest that people learning English _________ willing to study at least 15 minutes a day.
A) are 
B) is 
C) be 
D) should 
E) None of the above. 

"People x willing", the subject is plural, so "is" and "be" are wrong.
The present, continuous tense (eg, "is running", "has been eating") requires
a "be", "is", "been", "were" -type aux verb.  So we can have "are willing"
or "should be willing".  So "should willing" is wrong.  
"are" is grammatically correct.  Depending on the context, it might
make perfect sense ("I'm presenting my research on the habits of people
learning English.  In my paper, I suggest that people learning English are
willing to study at least 15 minutes a day.")



#20 _________ my advice, she would have gotten promoted to Vice President of Marketing at the end of last year.
A) She has taken 
B) If she took 
C) Had she taken 
D) Has she taken 
E) None of the above. 


"she would have gotten" requires an if/then relation using the same
tense and conjugation.  So B is wrong (it should be "If she had taken")
